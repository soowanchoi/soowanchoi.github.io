I left Seoul when I was 1 year old and spent 5 years of my childhood in Moscow, where my dad started his new job. 

The following two photos triggered a memory of my past self:

In the picture above, my older brother is riding a camel(?) in the streets of Moscow while I sit in the baby chair with a pout. I think I was upset that I didn't get to ride the camel(?).

And so I was really happy to ride a camel when our family travelled to Egypt in 2005, as seen in the picture below.

But then I remember falling off and faceplanting in a pile of camel poop.
