As I ate my mini-egg croissant sandwich today, I couldn't help but notice how similar the taste was to an egg tart.    
I had changed my original order from the ham & cheese croissant to the mini-egg croissant because:

1. I wanted to try a new type of croissant from the cafe
2. The visual of the mini-egg croissant caught my attention
<br/><br/>
_I am not a fan of egg tarts._ 
   
All I could think of was a mashed up bowl of potato and eggs as I chewed on the croissant with my eyes closed.
   
But with my eyes open, the croissant tasted pretty good. I think it was due to its abstract texture.   
How odd that the visual aesthetic of food could have such an impact on its taste.  
Or maybe I was just hungry.
