As I ate my mini-egg croissant sandwich today, I couldn't help but notice how similar the taste was to an egg tart. 
I had changed my original order from the ham & cheese croissant to the mini-egg croissant because:
1. I wanted to try a new type of croissant from the cafe
2. The visual of the mini-egg croissant caught my attention
I am not a fan of egg tarts. 
As I chewed on my egg tart tasting croissant, I realized how the visual aesthetic of food could influence its taste.
I could visualize a mashed up potato with eggs in a large bowl when chewing on the croissant with my eyes closed.
However, as I ate my croissant while admiring its artistic texture, I felt like a real food connoisseur. It tasted great with my eyes open. How odd.
