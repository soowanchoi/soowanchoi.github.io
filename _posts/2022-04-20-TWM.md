Like many others, I couldn't wait to grow up and become independent.    
To become financially free. To travel where I want. To finish an enormous pile of KitKat bars by myself.    
We become focused on achieving our own milestones in our lives,    
We forget that our parents grow old with us.    


When I get a haircut, the barber usually washes my hair with a light scalp massage. I revel in it.    
Why? It makes me remember the feelings I had when I was younger. The feeling of being dependent. It's not a bad feeling.
