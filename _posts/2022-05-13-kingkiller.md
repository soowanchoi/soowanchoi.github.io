Recently, I finished the first two books of the heroic fantasy trilogy by Patrick Rothfuss, The Kingkiller Chronicle.   

The first book is **The Name of the Wind**.
- The Name of the Wind follows the story of a young boy (Kvothe), as he spends his childhood traveling with his family of troupers,
to his time lost in the city of Tarbean, to his admission into the University.     

The second book is **The Wise Man's Fear**.   
- The Wise Man's Fear continues the story of Kvothe as he searches for the truth regarding the Amyr and the Chandrian. 
His journey consists of the Adem mercenaries, the Fae realm, and his heroic display of 'magic'.   

The writing style alternates between two timelines, as Kvothe tells his story to his companion in present time.   
The story has a spice of romance which adds to the plot.   
This is a series that plays a movie in your brain as you read - I just couldn't put the book down. 

After 11 years, the third book is estimated for release in July? 2022.   
The title of the third book is **Doors of Stone**.   
Can't wait.
