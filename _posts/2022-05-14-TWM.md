Knowledge that we know but easily forget...

> "If the culture doesn't work, don't buy it.   
> Create your own."

> "I may be dying, but I am surrounded by loving, caring souls.   
> How many people can say that?"

> "Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel.   
> And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them too -   
> even when you're in the dark.   
> Even when you're falling."

> "Once you learn how to die,   
> you learn how to live."

> "So once again, I dove into work.   
> I worked because I could control it.   
> I worked because work was sensible and responsive."

> "Yes. Detaching myself.   
> And this is important - not just for someone like me, who is dying, but for someone like you, who is perfectly healthy.   
> Learn to detach. [...] Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent."

> "But detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you.   
> On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully.   
> That's how you are able to leave it."

> "Take any emotion - love for a woman, or grief for a loved one, or what I'm going through, fear and pain from a deadly illness.   
> If you hold back on the emotions - if you don't allow yourself to go all the way through them -       
> you can never get to being detached, you're too busy being afraid.  
> You're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief.    
> You're afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails."

> "But by throwing yourself into these emotions,   
> by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even,   
> you experience them fully and completely.   
> You know what pain is. You know what love is. You know what grief is.    
> And only then can you say,    
> 'All right. I have experienced that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment.' "

> "We all know how to be a child.   
> It's inside all of us.    
> For me, it's just remembering how to enjoy it."

> "It's very simple.    
> As you grow, you learn more.    
> If you stayed at twenty-two, you'd always be as ignorant as you were at twenty-two.    
> Aging is not just decay, you know.    
> It's growth.    
> It's more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it."

> "If you're always battling against getting older,    
> you're always going to be unhappy,    
> because it will happen anyhow."

> "Devote yourself to loving others,   
> devote yourself to your community around you,   
> and devote yourslef to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."

> "And love is how you stay alive,   
> even after you are gone."

> "And if you want to cry a little, it's okay."

> "They don't know what they want in a partner.   
> They don't know who they are themselves -   
> so how can they know who they're marrying?"

> "I've learned this much about marriage. You get tested.   
> You find out who you are, who the other person is, and how you accommodate or don't."

> "Invest in the human family.   
> Invest in people.   
> Build a little community of those you love and who love you."

> "As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had,   
> we can die without ever really going away.   
> ALl the love you created is still there.   
> All the memories are still there.   
> You live on - in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here."

> "Death ends a life, not a relationship."

> "In business, people negotiate to win.   
> They negotiate to get what they want.    
> [...] Love is different.    
> Love is when you are as concerned about someone else's situation as you are about your own."

**_'None of us can undo what we've done, or relive a life already recorded.   
But if Professor Morris Schwartz taught me anything at all, it was this:   
there is no such thing as "too late" in life.   
He was changing until the day he said good-bye.'_ - Mitch Albom**


Like many others, I couldn't wait to grow up and become independent. I wanted to become financially free and travel while finishing an enormous pile of KitKat bars by myself. The problem is, I have become so focused on achieving milestones that I tend to forget that my parents age with me.  

Reading this memoir made me remember the feelings I had when I was younger.   
The feeling of being dependent.   
It's not a bad feeling.
