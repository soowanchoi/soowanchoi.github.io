**Book Title**   
Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art   
(_non-fiction_)

**Author**   
James Nestor

**Review**   
This book contains a plethora of information on breathing.   
After skimming the book,   
one specific takeaway that I would like to test for myself:   

> "Breathing slow, less, and through the nose balances the levels of respiratory gases in the body   
> and sends the maximum amount of oxygen to the maximum amount of tissues   
> so that our cells have the maxmimum amount of electron reactivity."
