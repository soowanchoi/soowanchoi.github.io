**Book Title**   
Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art

**Author**   
James Nestor

**Review**
After skimming the extensive information about breathing provided in the book,   
one specific takeaway that I would like to test for myself:   

> "Breathing slow, less, and through the nose balances the levels of respiratory gases in the body   
> and sends the maximum amount of oxygen to the maximum amount of tissues   
> so that our cells have the maxmimum amount of electron reactivity."
