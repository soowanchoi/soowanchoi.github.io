This book was a loooooooong read.   
But also totally worth the adventure.

**Book Title**   
The Count of Monte Cristo   
(_fiction_)

**Author**   
Alexandre Dumas

**Review**   
The Count of Monte Cristo is a story of a man, Edmond Dantes, as he seeks revenge after getting framed and imprisoned for 13 years.   
Although this story unfolds in a predictable way, it is richly filled with different character perspectives.   
The most interesting perspective is how Edmond's motive for revenge is reasoned with his affection for the love of his life.     

> "I have in my heart three feelings with which one can never be bored: sadness, love and gratitude."      

Set in France and Italy after the fall of Napolean's Empire, this story is filled with charismatic characters and interweaving plots.   

The following passage is an example of the charismatic viewpoint spoken by the 'Count of Monte Cristo':

> "Should a jurist not be, not the best applier of the law or the cleverest interpreter of legal quibbles,   
> but a steel probe for the testing of hearts and a touchstone against which to assay the gold that every soul contains in greater or lesser amounts?"

_a great analogy._
