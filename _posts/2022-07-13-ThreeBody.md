Liu Cixin

**Review**   
Yesterday, NASA's Webb Space Telescope captured the deepest images of the universe from approximately 7,600 light-years away.
These photos reminded me to record a recent science fiction book that I read, which explores topics on the fundamental nature of our universe. 
Three-Body Problem is set with China's Cultural Revolution as the backdrop, and causes the reader to question the morality of the characters choices. 
I can't say much about the book, as reading without answers to the questions faced by the characters adds to the experience.

Although I haven't read much science fiction novels, this book was definitely one of the best that I have read in the genre.
