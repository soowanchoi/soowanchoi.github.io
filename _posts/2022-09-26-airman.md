(_fiction_ | _historical/science fiction_)

**Author**   
Eoin Colfer

**Review**   
This is a book that my older brother recommended me to read numerous times. Since I was 12. And I wish I had read it sooner.  

Eoin Colfer does an exceptional job at pacing the story, as there was never a moment where I thought he was skipping important details or going overboard with the description.   

Airman follows the typical storyline of a boy that gets framed for treason, and spends his days in prison looking for a way to escape. When I initially read the plot of the book, I had doubts as it seemed very similar to the classic, The Count of Monte Cristo. What I hadn't accounted for was Eoin Colfer's unique writing style or the scientific brain equipped by the main character, Conor Broekhart.   

If you're a young adult, I highly recommend this underrated novel. Or even if you're in your twenties. Don't wait until you're too old, as you will regret it. Speaking from experience.
