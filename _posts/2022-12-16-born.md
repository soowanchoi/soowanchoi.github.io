**Author**   
Trevor Noah

**Review**   
This book explores the topic of racism as experienced by Trevor Noah, a person with a mixed ethnicity. He was born in 1984 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Trevor was born during apartheid, which is defined as a system of discrimination based on race - at the time, the ultimate goal of apartheid in South Africa was to create a predominantly white race. 

"In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid."

Trevor does an excellent job discussing the absurdity of racism using witty remarks with a perfect pinch of humour. 

South Africa was separated into two main groups: Zulu, which Trevor described as people with more pride comparable to that of warriors, and the Xhosa, which were people that pride themselves as the 'thinkers'. Trevor's mother was a Xhosa, and she was the main influence for Trevor seeking a better life.
