Trevor Noah

**Review**   
This book explores the topic of racism as experienced by Trevor Noah, an individual with mixed ethnicity. He was born to a Swiss-German father and Xhosa mother in 1984 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Trevor was born during apartheid, which is defined as a system of discrimination based on race - at the time, the ultimate goal of apartheid in South Africa was to create a predominantly white race. 

> "In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid."

Afrikaners are a South African ethnic group that descended from Dutch settlers. Upon gaining control of the South African government in 1948, the Afrikaner National Party sent commissions to other parts of the world such as the Netherlands and Australia to learn how to create the perfect system of racism. Hence, apartheid was born. 

Trevor does an excellent job discussing the absurdity of racism using witty remarks with a perfect pinch of humour. 

> "It's a powerful experience, shitting. There's something magical about it, profound even. I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility. I don't care who you are, we all shit the same. Beyonce shits. The pope shits. The Queen of England shits. When we shit we forget our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or rich we are. All of that goes away."

As exemplified through such a simple act, humans are connected to one another regardless of race. Trevor also discusses the importance of language and the polar effect communication has in bringing people together or separating them.

> "Language brings with it an identity and culture, or at least the perception of it... Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well. If you're racist and you meet someone who doesn't look like you, the fact that he can't speak like you reinforces your racist preconceptions: He's different, less intelligent... language, even more than colour, defines who you are to people."

As a Korean-Canadian, I vouch for this statement. I realized that I was more readily accepted by my caucasian peers once I learned to speak english with the same accent and demeanor. This also applies when speaking to my Korean friends. Even though we may be from the same ethnic background, not being able to speak korean in the same distinctive accent as my Korean friends creates a sense of separation.

Overall, 'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah allows you to experience the concept of poverty and apartheid through the lens of comedy. That being said, this book will inspire you to take action, in pursuit of a meaningful life.

> "We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to."

_**Note:** South Africa was separated into two main groups: Zulu, which Trevor described as people with more pride comparable to that of warriors, and the Xhosa, which were people that valued themselves as the 'thinkers'. Trevor's mother was a Xhosa, and she was the main influence for Trevor seeking a better life._
