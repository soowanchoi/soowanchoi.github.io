Man's Search for Meaning      
(_non-fiction_ | _autobiography_)

**Author**   
Viktor E. Frankl

**Review**   
Through _Man's Search for Meaning_, the reader traverses through the life of a man that survived the concentration camps during World War II. Viktor E. Frankl states that each individual is responsible for finding their own meaning in life, regardless of their life situation. 

Frankl believed that life was primarily a pursuit for meaning, rather than for pleasure or power. These sources of meaning include: finding significance in work, experiencing values (through love for others or finding beauty in art), and choosing to respond a certain way to inevitable suffering. Through his experience at Auschwitz, Frankl was able to reinforce his beliefs as he found the courage to survive through memories of his wife and his desire to teach psychology after the war. 

> "... success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself of as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself."

By caring less about success, I realized that I was on the right path towards what I considered success: good health and a lifestyle that allows for quality time with family and friends. 

Frankl mentions that the three mental stages that a prisoner experiences are: shock, apathy in routine, and disillusionment upon liberation. During one of the nights at Auschwitz, Frankl recalls a fellow prisoner having a horrible nightmare. However, he refused to wake him up.

> "At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him."

Without blunting one's emotions, each prisoner will fall victim to delirium in such an abnormal situation. However, Frankl emphasizes that a person can achieve fulfillment through the "image he carries of his beloved".

> "I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved."

Frankl was able to find hope by reflecting and conjuring thoughts of his wife.

> "This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past."

Frankl also mentions the importance of humour.

> "...humour, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds."

> "No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same."

> "Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human dignity ... the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an indiviudal, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value."

Emphasis on 'a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value'.
