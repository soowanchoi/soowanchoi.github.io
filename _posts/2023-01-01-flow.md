**Review**   
This book delves deep into a discussion of the 'flow' state, which is essentially a focused state of mind that creates a deep sense of enjoyment for the task at hand. The author understands through psychology that people are only satisfied when they feel 'good' about their lives, and that the goal of getting rich or successful is not the only factor for feeling this 'goodness'. Instead, he shows the reader that by achieving the so called 'flow' state, one can achieve happiness as a by-product of becoming present in the moment. 

> "Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment."

> "How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences."

> "The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present."

> "Civilization is built on the repression of individual desires...the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longercan imagine themselves breaking any of its rules."

It is mentioned that the ability to perceive adversity as a challenge to overcome is the most important trait for succeeding in life and enjoying each moment. Is this a personality trait that can be acquired through practice?

> "While we are thinking about a problem we cannot truly experience happiness of sadness...exhausts most of our capacity for attention."

> "The limitation of consciousness is demonstrated by the fact that to understand what another person is saying we must process 40 bits of information each second. If we assume the upper limit of our capacity to be 126 bits per second, it follows that to understand what three people are saying simultaneously is theoretically possible, but only by managing to keep out of consciousness every other thought of sensation."

> "In any case, an individual can experience only so much. Therefore, the information we allow into consciousness becomes extremely important; it is, in fact, what determines the content and the quality of life."

> "The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer."

Control of consciousness is linked to self-awareness, which helps one become more mindful of the present moment. 

> "The names we use to describe personality traits - such as _extrovert_, _high achiever_, or _paranoid_ - refer to the specific patterns people have used to structure their attention. At the same party, the extrovert will seek out and enjoy interactions with others, the high achiever will look for useful business contacts, and the paranoid will be on guard for signs of danger he must avoid."

> "Memories, thoughts and feelings are all shaped by how we use it. And it is an energy under our control, to do with as we please; hence, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience."

> "THERE ARE TWO MAIN STRATEGIES we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match our goals. The second is the change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better."

This resonates with me. For example, I am able to control the design of my room, whereas shared parts of the house (such as the living room) is out of my control. Thus, by letting go of unnecessary desires, the threat of a messy living room does not directly affect my happiness. 

Mihaly also touches on the fact that pleasure is necessary to maintain order, but that it does not help with "creating new order in consciousness".

> "Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative _homeostatic_ experiences that return consciousness to order after the needs of the body intrude and cause psychic entropy to occur. But they do not produce psychological growth."

So how do we experience this 'flow' state?

> "First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment..."

Thus, to achieve a state of flow, one must either be pushed to the limits of their physical exertion, or stay highly disciplined with their mental activity.

> "activation _decreased_ when they were concentrating. Instead of requiring more effort, investment of attention actually seemed to decrease mental effort."

To summarize, the blueprint for experiencing flow is:
1) attention to detail
2) set goals
3) receive feedback to stay on track

> "Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of our century, described how he achieved personal happiness: 'Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection."

Similarly, I feel the most joy when I focus on my senses and direct my full attention to the external source at hand. Otherwise, if I focus too much on myself, I lose my focus and at times feel self-conscious which sucks the pleasure from the immediate experience. 

> "the easiest step toward improving the quality of life consists in simply learning to control the body and its senses."

Since without a body, we are unable to experience!

> "The ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude, with no external demands to give structure to attention...a person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favourable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life."

> "It is difficult to notice the environment as long as attention is mainly focused inward, as long as most of one's psychic energy is absorbed by the concerns and desired of the ego."

> "To experience psychic entropy one must concentrate on the internal disorder; but by paying attention to what is happening around oneself instead, the destructive effects of stress are lessened."

As the 'complexity of our culture evolves' the increased career choices makes it proportionally difficult to commit to one single goal and experience flow. However, that does not mean that the past with less freedom of choice was better. We have a larger potential now - if we master our choice.

We must learn a new way to master the present moment as the way back to simpler times is impossible. 

We must learn to cooperate with the laws of nature as much as we are different from other species.
