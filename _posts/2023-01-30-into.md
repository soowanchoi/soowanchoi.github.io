**Book Title**   
Into Thin Air      
(_non-fiction_ | _memoir/adventure_)

**Author**   
Jon Krakauer

**Review**   
This book delves deep into a discussion of the 'flow' state, which is essentially a focused state of mind that creates a deep sense of enjoyment for the task at hand. Through psychology, the author understands that people are only satisfied when they feel 'good' about their lives, and that the goal of getting rich or successful is not the only factor for feeling this 'goodness'. Instead, he shows the reader that by achieving the so called 'flow' state, one can achieve happiness as a by-product of being present in the moment.
