Animal Farm      
(_fiction_ | _political satire/allegory_)

**Author**   
George Orwell

**Review**    
I have been told that Animal Farm is a must read since as long as I can remember. I never got around to reading it, as I thought the perspective of 
fictional animals was ridiculous. Once finished, I now understand why it has been a recommended read - I wish I had read it when I was younger.

This is the first George Orwell book that I have read, and I must say he deserves the praise that he has received to this day. His depiction of politics 
through a fable story of animals living on a farm is simple yet exceptional. Orwell portrays a totalitarian rule through the pigs, and shows how a revolution 
can come full circle to end up where it started - just with a different appearance. Through this story, Orwell seems to tell the reader to critically examine
the life we live, or risk blending in with a generation of fools.  


**Note:** readers mention that Animal Farm represents the Russian Revolution leading to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union through Stalin.
