**Review**   
사랑하는 사람과의 다툼에서 서로가 휩쓸여 들어간 대화법이 진정한 적이라는 것을 인식하는 법?

Found my friend with this book during our travels and it immediately caught my attention. 

Hold me tight is a self-help book discussing the topic of love, and finding ways to fix hurt relationships and maintaining renewed love through 
communication and understanding. Although the book touched on effective methods for couple therapy such as 'finding the common enemy' (_Demon Dialogue_)
and ways to connect within a safe emotional environment, I personally found the book to be longer than needed with anecdotal examples.  

For individuals that currently feel lost in their relationship, whether with their significant other or a family member, this book may serve
as a reminder of what it takes to connect again. However, do read with an open mind and willingness to learn again, or suffer a read that seems
to run in circles all to remind us how to love and be loved. 

to apologize:
1) Care about their pain
2) Own up to specific actions
3) Reassure to help    
*** Don't expect forgiveness as it is their choice
