**Book Title**   
Cat's Cradle     
(_fiction_ | _satire/science-fiction_)

**Author**   
Kurt Vonnegut

**Review**   
Making meaning out of something meaningless (maybe a perspective on life) - creating a cat and a cradle out of a string but others don't see the cat or the cradle. Juxtaposing the necessity and ridiculousness of religion and the beliefs that follow. 

> "Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before ... He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way."

The quote above took me some time to realize that it describes academics, scientists and those that seek knowledge, and how their journey in search of knowledge makes them realize how little they really know of the world. 

> "Midget, midget, midget, how he struts and winks. For he knows a man's as big as what he hopes and thinks!"

A person is more than what meets the eye, as those with strong values and beliefs can create an impact on the world (for better or worse).
