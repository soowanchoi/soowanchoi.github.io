(_fiction_ | _dystopian_)

**Author**   
Lois Lowry      

**Review**   
This book is set in a dystopian fictional setting, where the characters are not able to feel pain - or feel anything, for that matter.   
Given the opportunity to be different, Jonas decides to explore the system that he was born into.  
He finds out a lot more about his community than what meets the eye - or what doesn't.   
For Jonas, the magic in being able to experience pain represents the happiness gained from the freedom to choose.

- "...I found myself with people who shared my interests. I made friends on a new level, friends of all ages."
