**Book Title**   
Zero to One      
(_non-fiction_ | _strategy_)

**Author**   
Blake Masters and Peter Thiel     

**Review**   
**The Challenge of the Future**
> Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done,    
> but you also need to **stay small enough** so that you actually can.

- Big organizations progress slowly due to large bureacracy.

**Party Like It's 1999**
> Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost...   
> So we decided to **pay people to sign up**... new customers $10 for joining, ... $10 more every time they referred a friend.

- Investment. Pay to attract a consistent influx of customers. Take a small fee on transactions.
- Each customer makes **n** transactions and thus make back the $10

> 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
> 2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
> 3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
> 4. Sales matter just as much as product.

- How much of these are based on anectdotal evidence?

**All Happy Companies are Different**
> Under perfect competition, in the long run _no company makes an economic profit._   
> ...**capitalism and competition are opposites**.   
> Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.   

- Perfect Competition. New companies join the market. Supply exceeds demand. Prices decrease.
- Some companies fold. Prices back to equilibrium. Thus, competition is a slave to market price.
- Therefore, differentiate!!!

> Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the _intersection_ of various smaller markets:   
    > ex. British food n restaurant n Palo Alto   
> Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the _union_ of several large markets:   
    > ex. search engine u mobile phones u wearable computers u self-driving cars

- Non-monoplists act like a monopoly
- Monopolists disguise their monopoly

**Last Mover Advantage**
> ...the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future   
> ...discount those future cash flows to their present worth

- Present value of a business is dependent on future cash flow

> Monopolies share the following characteristics:
  1. **Proprietary Technology.** Own a technology that works 10x better than competition or be the first to create it.
  2. **Network Effects.** Use peer pressure or FOMO to your advantage. Market needs to be niche or unsaturated.
  3. **Economies of Sale.** Service business have limitations for scaling whereas software has few workers that could reach millions.
  4. **Branding.** Quality precedes simply branding yourself.

> Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market.

- _Therefore, every startup should **start with a very small market.**_

> ...core progression - to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets.

- Amazon started small as an online catalog of books and then expanded to different markets.

**Foundations**
> Equity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations.
> Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term
> and a commitment to increasing your company's value in the future.

- Equity vs Liquid Cash

**The Mechanics of Mafia**
> Elon Musk - SpaceX, Tesla Motors
> Reid Hoffman - LinkedIn
> Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim - YouTube
> Jeremy Stoppelman, Russel Simmons - Yelp
> David Sacks - Yammer
> Peter Thiel - Palantir

- Silicon Valley "PayPal Mafia"

**If You Build It, Will They Come?**
> Two metrics set the limits for effective distribution

1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- The total net profit that you earn on average over the course of your relationship with the customer >
- amount you spend on average to acquire a new customer
- User these metrics to determine path to: **Sales vs Viral Distribution vs Marketing/Advertising**

**Man and Machine**
> Watson, Deep Blue, ... machine learning algorithms are cool.
> But the most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone.
> Instead, they'll ask: **_how can computers help humans solve hard problems?_**

- Computers are good for data processing, bad at basic judgments (that are otherwise simple for humans)

**Seeing Green**
> One or more of the 7 Questions every business must answer:
1. The Engineering Question
    - Can you create **breakthrough technology** instead of incremental improvements?
2. The Timing Question
    - Is now the **right time to start** your particular business?
3. The Monopoly Question
    - Are you starting with a **big share of a small market**?
4. The People Question
    - Do you have the **right team**?
5. The Distribution Question
    - Do you have a way to **not just create but deliver** your product?
6. The Durability Question
    - Will your **market position be defensible 10 and 20 years** into the future?
7. The Secret Question
    - Have you identified a **unique opportunity** that others don't see?
  
> Tesla built a unique brand around the secret that cleantech
> was even more of a social phenomenon
> than an environmental imperative.

- Some truth to it's success
