**Book Title**   
Zero to One      
(_non-fiction_ | _strategy_)

**Author**   
Blake Masters and Peter Thiel     

**Review**   
**The Challenge of the Future**
> Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done,    
> but you also need to **stay small enough** so that you actually can.

- Big organizations progress slowly due to large bureacracy.

**Party Like It's 1999**
> Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost...   
> So we decided to **pay people to sign up**... new customers $10 for joining, ... $10 more every time they referred a friend.

- Investment. Pay to attract a consistent influx of customers. Take a small fee on transactions.
- Each customer makes **n** transactions and thus make back the $10

> 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
> 2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
> 3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
> 4. Sales matter just as much as product.

- How much of these are based on anectdotal evidence?

**All Happy Companies are Different**
> Under perfect competition, in the long run _no company makes an economic profit._   
> ...**capitalism and competition are opposites**.   
> Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.   

- Perfect Competition. New companies join the market. Supply exceeds demand. Prices decrease.
- Some companies fold. Prices back to equilibrium. Thus, competition is a slave to market price.
- Therefore, differentiate!!!

> Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the _intersection_ of various smaller markets:   
    > ex. British food n restaurant n Palo Alto   
> Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the _union_ of several large markets:   
    > ex. search engine u mobile phones u wearable computers u self-driving cars

- Non-monoplists act like a monopoly
- Monopolists disguise their monopoly

**Last Mover Advantage**
> ...the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future   
> ...discount those future cash flows to their present worth

- Present value of a business is dependent on future cash flow

> Monopolies share the following characteristics:
  1. **Proprietary Technology.** Own a technology that works 10x better than competition or be the first to create it.
  2. **Network Effects.** Use peer pressure or FOMO to your advantage. Market needs to be niche or unsaturated.
  3. **Economies of Sale.** Service business have limitations for scaling whereas software has few workers that could reach millions.
  4. **Branding.** Quality precedes simply branding yourself.

> Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market.

- _Therefore, every startup should **start with a very small market.**_

> ...core progression - to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets.

- Amazon started small as an online catalog of books and then expanded to different markets.
