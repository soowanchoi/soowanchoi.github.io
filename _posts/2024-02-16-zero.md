**Book Title**   
Zero to One      
(_non-fiction_ | _strategy_)

**Author**   
Blake Masters and Peter Thiel     

**Review**   
> Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done,
> but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

- Big organizations progress slowly due to large bureacracy.

> Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through.
> So we decided to pay people to sign up... new customers $10 for joining, ... $10 more every time they referred a friend.

- Investment. Pay to attract a consistent influx of customers. Take a small fee on transactions.
- Each customer makes **n** transactions and thus make back the $10

> 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
> 2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
> 3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
> 4. Sales matter just as much as product.
