**Book Title**   
The Wealthy Barber Returns         
(_non-fiction_ | _Personal-Finance_)

**Author**   
David Chilton        

**Review**   
**A Painful Truth and a Positive Spin**
> You'll have to learn to spend less than you make.   
> Every after-tax dollar we receive can either be spent (consumed) or saved.

**Consumed with Consumption**
> Seneca said 2,000 years ago,   
> "These individuals have riches just as we say that we have a fever, when really the fever has us."

**Status Update**
> "It is the eyes of others and not our own eyes which ruin us.   
> If all the world were blind except myself   
> I should not care for fine clothes or furniture."   

**Choose Your Friends Wisely**
> Sadly, we often can't appreciate what we have for its own merit.   
> Instead, we only consider ourselves fortunate when we have as much   
> (or even better, more than!)   
> those with whom we most closely identify.   

> Interestingly, there is a subset of people for whom this like-reference group selection happens quite naturally: teachers.   
> Thomas J. Stanley, PhD, the author of the mega-selling _The Millionaire Next Door_,   
> has long argued that the fact that teachers only work with people of similar incomes - other teachers -   
> ... they are so adept at living within their means... top of the financially responsible pile.    

**The Power of Perspective**
> Is it really that big a deal that your friend at work has a 32-jet, six-person hot tub and you don't?   
> Nine hundred million people across the globe don't have ongoing access to safe drinking water.

**Plastic Surgery**
> I fear credit cards.   
> Making minimum monthly payments and carrying your debt at 18% (or higher)   
> is not a recommended financial-planning strategy.

**All Too Willing to Lend a Hand**
> ... head to a bank's loan department and arrange for a $30,000 secured line of credit - nothing more.     
> Pay off the credit cards with the LOC, thereby refinancing from 18% debt to 3% debt, and cut up the cards...   
> ...set up a monthly pre-authorized transfer from chequing account to chisel away at the loan.

**A Borrowed Approach to Borrowing**
> ...used pre-authorized chequing and payroll deductions to fully fund their RRSPs...

**Under House Arrest**
> Live in a house you can _truly_ afford.

> Recently, I breathlessly ranted to a banker,   
> "It's crazy that if two couples come to see you and they have the same gross family income,   
> you'll qualify them for the same mortgage size even if Mr. and Mrs. A are planning on remaining childless   
> and are members of generous defined-benefit pension plans where they don't even have to make contributions   
> while Mr. and Mrs. B have three kids and no pensions. It's nonsense!"

> Charles Farrell (_Your Money Ratios_)   
> Thomas J. Stanley (_The Millionaire Next Door_)

**My Frustration**
> Pay yourself first!

> ...pay yourself first, start now, live within your means. 

**A Worthwhile Hassle**
> ...advocates keeping a detailed summary of all your expenses over a period of several months.

> Splurge-worthy. I like that.

> ... don't just spend less, they spend better.

**And Furthermore**
> ...the totals in the same three spending areas seem to have caught them the most off guard:   
> (1) cars; (2) dining out; and (3) little things.

> ...they have never grouped their car payments with their insurance premiums,   
> maintenance costs and gas charges. When they did, they were absolutely shocked.

> Shock! That's the only way to describe people's reactions to their spending on "little things."     
> Nobody, and I mean nobody, can believe how the purchases of under $20 add up.   
> From magazines to cappuccinos to golf balls to movie to lottery tickets to treats for the kids    
> to greeting cards to batteries to eyeshadow... well, you get the idea. It never ends!

> I was taken aback by how good savers, just like not-so-good savers,   
> had areas of indulgence and seemingly excessive spending.   
> Frequently, it was travel. Often it was a hobby like golf.   
> Sometimes, it was my weakness: dining out.   
> Good savers are not passionless robots!   
> They find many things and experiences (usually the latter) splurge-worthy.   
> But they have the common sense and the requisite Grade 2 math skills   
> to recognize that extra spending in one area requires extra discipline in others.

> By the way, don't let any of this affect how much you spend on books.

**The $64,000 Question**
> The number 1 enemy of retirees - inflation - is an inevitable visitor.   
> [Save] between 10 and 15% of your gross income.

**When You Assume**
> ...started to save only a decade later,   
> he now has to save 2.29 times as much per month to catch up to Hank.
> ...more than 18% of his $50,000 income.

> 'The best time to plant an oak tree was 20 years ago.   
> The second best time is now.'

**"That Doesn't Apply to Me!"**
> ...if you can't live on 60 to 70% of your pre-retirement income in that situation,   
> I don't think any book can help you.

> I have a friend whose plan will pay her 1.5% of her last working-year's salary for each year she has worked for the company.   
> If she ends up spending her entire career there, say 40 years, her pension will pay her 60% of her final year's pay as an employee.   
> And she has no deductions from her paycheque!

> ...the government defined-benefit plans are fantastic.

**"That Doesn't Apply to Me, Either!"**
> ...wealth flows from savings, not from income.

> ...expenses don't tend to fall off as much in retirement for this group [low-earners] as they do for higher earners.

**Money is Time**
> "A dollar saved is two dollars earned"

> When we buy something, we're really spending time, not money.

**Some Experience Required**
> ...declining marginal utility...watches and cars go from "wow" to "whatever" remarkably quickly.

> 'We generally found very consistent evidence that experiences made people happier than material possessions..."

> First, experiences don't grow mundane...being excited during the time leading up to an event is one of the best parts...
 
> The best things in life aren't things.

> ...wealth is not an absolute; instead, it is relative to desires.




**RANDOM THOUGHTS ON PERSONAL FINANCE**

**Common Themes**
> Leonardo da Vinci: "Simpicity is the ultimate sophistication."

**An Easy Choice**
> Good Advisor: "I have no idea where markets or economy are headed in the short term.     
> Nor does anyone else here. Our chief economist is brilliant, articulate and wrong more often than right.   
> Great golfer, though.

**A Cool Rule: The Rule of 72**   
- The years to double your money = 72/rate of return compounded annually   
- a good approximation of doubling time for rates from 2 to 18%
  
> My parents have owned their home for almost 48 years.   
> They bought it for $19,800 and it's now worth about $320,000.   
> Seems pretty impressive.   
> But what's "The Rule of 72" say?   
> Well, the house value doubled from 20K to 40K, then 40K to 80K, then 80K to 160K and, finally, from 160K to 320K.   
> That's 4 doubles in 48 years or 1 in every 12 years.   
> That's a compounded rate of return of 6% a year.

Albert Einstein: "The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest."

**The Illusion of Wealth**
> "Well, our house is currently worth about $600,000," my new friend began.   
> "But we're planning on moving to a condominium in a couple of years.   
> It'll cost us around $400,000. That will be our last stop, by the way.   
> Because the expenses there will be higher with monthly fees,   
> I've allotted $100,000 of the $200,000 excess to spin off an income to cover the increased costs.   
> So, essentially, we have only $100,000 in our house that we'll be able to convert to a true investment asset.   
> Is that a strange way to look at it or does it make sense to you?

> ...a lot of people heading toward retirement "house rich, investment poor."

> As real-estate prices in Kitchener-Waterloo have climbed,   
> they've dragged my parent's property taxes and insurance premiums up with them.

> ...don't forget sales-agents' commisions, lawyers' fees, land-transfer taxes, moving costs, and so on and so on.

**A Controversial Solution**
> ...a reverse mortgage, the borrower does not have to make ongoing payments on the loan     
>  and the balance isn't due until the home is sold.   
> ...a way to tap into one's home equity without moving. 

> Interest rates on reverse mortgages are significantly higher than those on conventional mortgages.   
> ...the borrower is turning finance's most powerful force - compounding - into an enemy...

> ...He conceded that he is normally very hesitant to recommend reverse mortgages,      
> but felt he may have come across an exceptional case.   
> An elderly client had been diagnosed with cancer and given only a few years to live.   
> She was adamant about not moving but couldn't afford proper in-home care on her low income.   
> She also wanted to help her grandson out with his university costs.   
> Initially, the advisor thought it was a rare, ideal time for a reverse mortgage,   
> which would allow her to stay in the house and free up the needed funds.   
> However, after thinking it through, he instead suggested a home-equity line of credit (HELOC).   
> He pushed her to borrow only as needed and to service the debt through writing cheques on the line of credit itself.   
> Sounds a little crazy at first blush, but makes sense.   
> Both her legal fees and her interest rate would be lower than with a reverse mortgage.

**Dashed Hopes**
> 'Never invest your money in anything that eats..'

**A Misunderstood Shortcut**
> Think of an index as an aid. A shortcut. A time saver.    
> All totals, averages, and medians are indices (or indexes). 

> Clearly, weighting by share price is a goofy idea.    
> Curiously, though, that's how one of the world's most famous indices,   
> the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is structured.

**Incredibly Interesting Math**
- The aggregate return of investors trying to beat the market _must_ match the market's return.

> (1) Could buy stocks on your own.   
- Crazy. Can't beat the legendary managers like Warren Buffett.   
> (2) Could put the entire $30,000 in the index fund.   
- **Guaranteed to tie the aggregate performance of the three legendary managers.**  
- If manager 1 outperforms market by 4% and manager 2 outperforms by 1%, manager 3 MUST underperform by 5%.  
- But not you. It might not outperform the market, but you're guaranteed to get the market return.   
> (3) Could place $10,000 with each of the legendary managers.   
- Match the market and end up in the same position as just buying the index fund in (2)
> (4) Could put the entire $30,000 with one manager.   
- Might or might not work out. How to figure out who to bet on?

> Cost of utilizing managers (2.3% annually)      
> Cost of utilizing index fund (0.5% annually), it still wins!
- Accepting the market averages (minus a bit for costs)
- automatically makes you an above-average investor. 

**I Wish I Could Help**
> Frequently, good short-term numbers are the result of the fund being overweighted in the market's surging sector.   
> Right place, right time.   
> Sadly, a whole whack of money flows into the fund based on its last couple of outstanding years   
> just in time to be introduced to the financial world's greatest humbler: regression to the mean.   
> Remember the tech bubble?

**Oblivious**
> ...rebalancing their portfolios periodically...   
> ...investors often chase their money away by watching it too closely.

**Unorthodox, But...**
> "It's simple. I follow only mature Canadian companies that have established track records of paying reasonable dividends.   
> From that group, I buy shares in firms that I do business with but hate."  
> I thought he was kidding but there was no accompanying chuckle. "Hate? What am I missing?"   
> "Well, if I hate these businesses but I'm still dealing with them, they must have a heck of a good situation.   
> Obviously, I really need whatever it is they're selling and the competition can't get at them.   
> A captive audience gives them pricing power and staying power - tough to beat!    

**A Widely Held Misconception**
> They last traded yesterday at $10 a share,   
> giving the company a market value of $10 million.  

> Realizing that no company named after me could truly be worth that much,   
> you wisely decide to sell your 1,000 shares.   
> Unfortunately, it's a rough day for equities and there are no buyers at $10 a share.   
> You're so eager to move on that you happily accept the best offer at $9.  

> Chilton Inc.'s market value is suddenly only $9 million. 

> By selling a mere $9,000 worth of stock,   
> you've lopped $1 million off the company's market value.   
> You've ruined the fun for all of us.

**The Silent Killer**
> The difference between the highest "bid" price for an investment asset (the most anybody wanting to buy is willing to pay)    
> and it's lowest "ask" price (the least anybody wanting to sell is willing to accept) is known as the "spread".

- How 'spread' should be described:  
> Difference between price you're willing to pay for the investment asset   
> and the price the next highest bidder under you is willing to pay.   
> So when you bid $5.20 on out stock, the newly defined spread will be $0.20   
> - your $5.20 bid price minus the next highest bid of $5.00.

> Assume the seller comes down and meets your $5.20 bid. Exciting!   
> But do you now own shares worth $5.20 each of $5.00 each?   
> Our adage and the real world of markets both say the latter.

**A Tough Call**  
> Go with the registered educational savings plan (RESP) first     
> until you've taken full advantage of the Canadian Educational Savings Grant (CESG).      
> Then, if you still have some money available, contribute to your retirement plan.   

> What if the RESP's beneficiaries don't go on to qualified post-secondary schools?   
> You could face a major tax bill and the CESG money may have to be repaid.

> Why? Because people _must_ save for retirement.   
> Especially if they're not members of pension plans.   
> Naturally, I don't want to see young graduates loaded down with debt.   
> But I'd rather see that than their parents struggling mightily to get by later in life.

**A Simple Idea**
> "In your marginal tax bracket of around 40%,   
> a $5,000 contribution will generate a refund of $2,000.
> Your $3,000 will take care of the rest.

> The Canadians who really get this go one step further.    
> They figure out how much they should be contributing annually to their retirement plans   
> and then set up a pre-authorized chequing (PAC) plan to have one-twelfth of that amount   
> transferred monthly to their RRSPs from their bank accounts. Once that's in place,   
> they apply to the Canada Revenue Agency for a tax reduction at source to reflect   
> the deductible RRSP contributions.

> So, using our example, Todd would set up a PAC plan for $417 a month - $5,000 a year.     
> He'd then apply to have his tax deduction at work reduced by $167 a month. Why?     
> Because his $5,000 contribution will lessen his taxes by $2,000 a year and that     
> amount divided by 12 is $167.     
> In the end, he'll have $250 ($417-$167) a month less than last year.      
> Sounds horrible, but guess what?     
> Over a year, that's the $3,000 he wasn't spending anyway - it's the same amount he was already saving.

**Battle of the Abbreviations**
> When you make an RRSP contribution, you get to deduct that amount from your taxable income.    
> The invesments inside your RRSP grow free of tax while they stay in the plan.   
> Down the road, however, when money is withdrawn directly from the RRSP or from the registered retirement income fund (RRIF)   
> or annuity to which the RRSP has been converted, it will be taxable.

> In essence, a TFSA is the mirror image of an RRSP.   
> You contribute after-tax dollars. In otherwords, you don't get a deduction for your contribution.   
> But once the money is in the plan, it not only grows free of tax, but also comes out free of tax.   
> No tax ever! Fantastico!

> Even the numerically challenged can understand that if the marginal tax rate is lower at the time of withdrawal   
> than at the time of contribution, the RRSP will win.   
> Conversely, if the marginal tax rate is higher at the time of withdrawal than at the time of contribution, the TFSA will win.

> When you withdraw money from your RRSP or RRIF (or receive an income from an annuity to which your RRSP was converted),   
> not only do you have to pay taxes on it, but your increased income could also lead to higher clawbacks of your Old Age Security pension,   
> Guaranteed Income Supplement and other means-tested government benefits.

> ...the effect an RRSP contribution can make on the amount of the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB) parents receive.   
> ...almost all of the researchers assumed every dollar withdrawn from and RRSP or RRIF will be taxed at the marginal tax rate.   
> Think about that - it's not always the case.   
> If I have $10,000 in government-pension income and receive a RRIF payment of $53,000, it's not _all_ going to be taxed at the marginal rate.   
> In some cases, it would be more appropriate to use the average rate of tax on the withdrawal in the calculations.

> The TFSA won a surprising percentage of the time (though usually not by a wide margin)
> TFSAs are very flexible.

**Are You Sure?**
> "If I'm saving $400 a month for my retirement,   
> am I better to put it into a TFSA or use it to pay down my mortgage?"

> She instructed her audience to contribute the previous-mortgage-payment amount to a TFSA _instead_   
> of just the original monthly savings. But she should have said _in addition to_.

**The Eternal Question**
> If the rate of return on the investment(s) you make with your TFSA contribution is higher than your debt's interest rate, the TFSA wins.      
> If lower, the debt paydown wins. If the same, it's a dead heat.

> Another alternative is to diversify by strategy.   
> That's a fancy way of saying invest for growth inside your TFSAs   
> with a portion of each month's savings and put the rest against your mortgage.

> ...paying off even a low-interest-rate mortgage may end up being a clever move if rates rise significantly.

**Unbowed**
> ...life insurance really comes in just two basic flavours: term and cash value.   
> With a term policy, you're buying coverage for a stipulated time frame. If the insured dies during that "term",   
> the beneficiaries collect the policy's face value. If not, they don't.

> When you purchase a cash-value policy,    
> each year the issuing company must extract a mortality charge   
> - a de facto term-insurance cost - from your cash value.   
> The rest of the money in your accumulation account can be invested in a variety of ways depending on the type of policy.

> But reasons not to bundle term insurance with your savings and investment:   
> (1) The mortality charges (i.e., the term insurance premiums) levied inside cash-value policies   
> are almost always more expensive than pure term-insurance premiums quoted in the marketplace;   
> (2) The available investments also usually involve higher fees   
> than most equivalent ones available outside of cash-value plans;   
> (3) Although cash-value policies do offer a tax-deferral opportunity, TFSAs ad RRSPs   
> are even more tax-efficient homes for your investments.   

**Potpourri**
> 1. Watch _Inside Job_, the Oscar-winning documentary on the credit crisis.   
> 2. Modern firms are incredibly complex entities...their _auditors_ get fooled regularly - what chance do most of us have?   
> 3. If you insist on building your own equity portfolio instead of using a mutual fund or ETF,   
> it's probably wise to emphasize companies that consistently pay a healthy dividend.   
> Cumulatively, that group has tended to outperform non-dividend-paying stocks and be less volatile.   
> 4. DRIPs - dividend reinvestment plans. Many companies throughout the world, including here in Canada,   
> offer investors the option to reinvest their dividends into more shares... Forced saving, compounding, zero to low costs, convenience!   
> 5. If you have a group RRSP at work and your employer matches all of part of your contribution, take advantage of it! 100% returne!!   
> 6. Many advisors are moving to a fee-based model. Some charge a flat or hourly fee but most charge a percentage of assets.   
> However, for clients with low-turnover portfolios, the old-fashioned, commission-based model may be a better deal.   
> 7. Over the next few years, the costs of financial products and financial advice are going to go down significantly.   
> Competition is heating up and consumers are becoming better educated - a powerful combination.   
> 8. (i) The best advisors are excellent communicators. They know how to listen, how to teach and how to coach;   
> (ii) They love to read about all thing money. That's probably a big part of how they developed their strong communication skills.   
> (iii) They spend their time developing and implementing sound financial plans, not trying to outsmart the stock market.   
> 9. Please keep your will updated. Do not draft your own will. Think _very_ carefully when selecting your executor.   
> 10. A will is revoked by marriage unless it states that it's being signed in contemplation of that marriage.   
> 11. Seniors should purchase annuities.   
> 12. Books to read:

**A Man With a Plan**
> "My wife and I use pre-authorized chequing to put as much as we're allowed to into RRSPs every year.   
> I use a spousal plan for some of my contribution dollars so that we'll end up with about the same   
> amount of money under each of our names. We want equal incomes in retirement for tax reasons."   

> "I put half our RRSP monies into GICs. Lately, I've been going longer term because rates are high,  
> but I usually spread it out so that I have money coming due every year.   
> The other half I put into stocks of big Canadian companies   
> and we're into dividend reinvestment plans where possible."  

> "Outside the RRSP, any extra money we've had we've put down on our debts.   
> Two years ago, we finished paying off our mortgage."  

> "Since then, I've used the extra cash to help out our son at university   
> and to start picking up some shares in stable companies like the banks and utilites."   
  
> "We have our will updated and a term-to-100 insurance policy   
> to cover off the taxes our estate will owe ont he farm when we die."  

> "That's it. Nothin' fancy."
