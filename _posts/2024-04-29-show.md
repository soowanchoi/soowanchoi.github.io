**Find Your Voice**   
Let go of the inner critic that tries to worry you about the fear of rejection.   
- It's about saying _Goodbye, thanks for sharing_, to those inner voices carping    
that you might not be ready, qualified, or worthy of the next opportunity.
- Even if you're saying something that's already been said, _it's your voice that matters_
- You don't have to be different to make a difference.
